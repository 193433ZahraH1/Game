        <h1>Mission!</h1>
        
        <h2> Social Change </h2>
	    <p>
		    We decided we wanted to create a games that teaches player about how people are viewed while on different levels of the economy. When the player has a few coins they are the smaller man who is more worn down. As they collect more coins they become bigger and the smaller people disappear. The game is meant to be a rude awakening in a way.
	    </p>
        <h2> Pseudo-Code </h2>
	    <p>
	    Create variable for score and set it to zero
Create variable for time and set it to zero
Create variable for charecter and set it as homelessman
Create Variable for is time up and set it to false
	If time is between 0-59 seconds display false

If variable is set to true
	If time is 60 seconds display true
	End Game(This will happen after 60 seconds

If variable is set to false 

Do the following in a repeaated loop
Once the time starts begin placing coins on screen 
If time is between 0-15 coin stays on screen for five seconds
If time is between 15-30 coin stays on screen for 3 seconds
If time is between 20-45 coin stays on screen for 2 seconds
If time is between 45-60 coin stays on screen for 1 second


If 0-10 coins are collected
	Then display homeless character
If 10-20 coins are collected 
Then display middle class character
If 20+ coins are collected
	Then display rich character

If bad charecter being hit is true
	Then reset score to 0 and reset charecter to homeless man

If bad charecter being hit is false
	Then score remains the same


After 60 seconds display true
	    </p>

        <h2>Example HTML Table for Game Theory Analysis</h2>
<table>
  <!--
    "tr" is the tag for "table row", "th" is "table header", and
    "td" is "table data"
  -->
	<tr> 
		<th colspan="2" rowspan="2"><!--intentionally empty--></th>
		<th colspan="2">Player 2</th> 
    <!--
      "colspan" is an attribute for setting a table cell to
      occupy multiple horizontal spaces
      "rowspan" does the same for vertical spaces
    -->
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <!--
      Replace the generic "Choice 1", Outcome 1", etc. with the
      actual choices and outcomes for your social issue
    -->
		<td class="choice">Choice 1</td>
		<td class="choice">Choice 2</td>
    <!--
      By using classes here, we can later add CSS to style all 
      the "choices" to look the same
    -->
