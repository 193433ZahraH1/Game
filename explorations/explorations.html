        <h2>The Board Game</h2>
        <p> The board game that my partner and I created was set in the middle of the jungle during the triassic time period. In our game, we chose to have our player pieces be dinosaurs. The point was to have the dinosaurs race each other to escape the orange mega dinosaur. Whoever escaped first wass the one who lived. The player who rolled the highest number went first, and the player who rolled the lowest number went last. In order to advance the dinosaur pawn, the player had to pick a card. If the player picked an even number, they rolled the dice two times. If the player picked an odd number, they rolled the dice one time. If players landed on a square with text, they had to follow the directions. The player who made it to the end square first was the winner. When we initially made the game, we struggled with the amount of wait time in between charecters. because we originally made it so that if a player rolled an odd number they couldn't go at all. That is why we made the change to have the charecter got once. Overall from this activity, I feel that I learned a lot about the player wo wasn't always active. I learned that it's important to keep all players engaged, even if they are waiting.

        <h1> The Video Game <h/2>
        <p> In this assignment we made a simple coin collector game. For this game, I created a turtle ti be my avatar, and the goal was to have him collect as many coins as he could before time ran out. I found this assignmnet a little challenging because the smallest spelling error would cause an issue, so revision was a very important step.
