<h1> About The Creators </h1>
<p> My name is Zahra Hutchinson, and I am a highschool senior at ESUMS. This is my first game creation, which I am making for my New Media and Tech for Social Change (Capstone) class. I really enjoy making games, so this project is a perfect fit.
</p>

<h2> What is a game </h2>
<p> In my opinion, a game is something that has a set of rules that can be played by yourself or with a group of people. I'd like to think that games are fun, but they aren't always for everyone.
</p>
 
<h2> My Gamer Type </h2>
<ol>
    <li>  73% Achiever </li> 
    <li> 73% Killer </li>
    <li> 33% Explorer </li>
    <li> 20% Socialiser </li>
</ol>

<h2> My Favorite Games </h2>
<p> I am a big fan of the card game spoons, because it is super competitve and fast pace, and it always brings a lot of laughter. I also like the game super smash bros, because you can either fight your friends or a cpu.
