        <h2>Progresion</h2>
        <p>  Initially we planned on creating a board game that was loosely based off of Jurasic park. We realized there was no social impact so we went baack to the drawing board. We then decided on a video game, but we were going to have a turtle as out charecter. After a group meeting, we found that having a charec ter that grows in size would better show how economic progression works.
